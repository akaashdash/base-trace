## Base Models

Best edge device LLM: https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-4.0-micro-base. 
Best edge device decoder embedder: https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B. 
Best edge device encoder embedder: https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct. 

No good open source, finance specific embedding models or LLMs :(
